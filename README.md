## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

I would like to use this data to look at affordability of housing in California based in on family size, age of occupants and their location with respect to the ocean. 
Since this data also includes latitude and longitude values, it would be great to build a dashboard that also has a map feature. 


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This data is sourced from 1990 census data in California. The data includes information about: longitude, latitude, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, median house value and ocean proximity. This dataset was posted in Kaggle to be used for student learning how to implement machine learning and data manipulation, but the original source was a governmental database as it cenuus data. The orginal data collection method is unknown, although given the age of the data is was likely collected on paper census forms before being transformed into digital data.
